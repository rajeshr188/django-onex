when a voucher is created/edited :
    a jounrnal(ledger/account) is created
    after that each time a voucher is updated
        last_journal.untransact()
        new_journal.transact()
when a line item :
        is created : then create a stock journal
                        update the voucher so that it creates ledger and account journals
        is updated: then last_Stock_journal.untransact() and new journal.transact()
                        update the voucher so that it creates ledger and account journals

lets say journal are of two types/three types
    1 Ledger Journal only involves Ledger Transaction of the assoiated voucher
    2 Account Journal only involves Account Transaction of the associated voucher
    3 Stock Journal only involves Stock Transaction of the associated voucher

    all these journal are created when a line item of the voucher is created/edited
